# Privacy Policy

Last updated: [Current Date]

## Overview

Tag Extension Manager ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Chrome extension.

## Information We Collect

We do not collect any personal information. The extension operates entirely locally on your device and does not transmit any data to external servers.

## Data Storage

The extension uses Chrome's local storage to save your preferences and settings, including:

- Extension states (enabled/disabled)
- Tag configurations
- Extension locks
- Theme preferences

All data is stored locally on your device and is not shared with any third parties.

## Permissions Used

The extension requires the following permissions to function:

- `management`: To manage other Chrome extensions, including enabling/disabling them and accessing their information for tag-based organization.
- `storage`: To save your preferences and settings locally on the device. No data is transmitted to external servers.
- `sidePanel`: To display the settings panel in Chrome's side panel interface, providing easy access to extension configuration.
  <!-- - `tabs`: To open extension options pages when requested by the user, allowing direct access to extension settings. -->
  <!-- - `scripting`: To detect system color scheme changes in the background, ensuring the extension's appearance matches the user's system preferences. It is also used to interact with web pages when necessary for extension management functionality. -->
- `activeTab`: To access the current tab when detecting system color scheme changes and for extension management operations. This ensures proper theme synchronization across the extension.
- `offscreen`: To detect system color scheme changes for theme synchronization, ensuring the extension's appearance matches the user's system preferences.

## Third-Party Services

We do not use any third-party services or analytics tools.
